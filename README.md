# NER-LSTM-Model
This project implements a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using TensorFlow and LSTMs. It preprocesses text, builds vocabularies, vectorizes sentences, and uses a custom loss function to handle padded labels. The trained model predicts entity tags for input sentences, showcasing its capabilities in sequence labeling tasks.
